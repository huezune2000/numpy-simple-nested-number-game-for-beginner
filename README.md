#  Nested Number-Guessing Game for Beginners
## A simple yet interactive number-guessing game for beginners.

# Description
## This is a simple number-guessing program, which is named "Nested Number-Game" because it uses a simple code where the if statements is nested in the while loop. The game is programmed to be interactive. The player will first be greeted with his/her name. Then the program will invite the player to play a number-guessing game, which is a pretty simple program using NumPy to generate a random integer.


# Process:
## The player now will be invited to play the game with a simple instruction to key in a number between 1 and 20.
## The "guess" number input by the player will run through the while loop, with conditions expressed in the if statement.
## The message, "THE NUMBER IS TOO HIGH. PLEASE TRY AGAIN!" will pop up to indicate the "guess" number is too high for the random number.
## The message, "THE NUMBER IS TOO LOW. PLEASE TRY AGAIN!" will pop up to indicate the "guess" number is too low for the random number.
## Iteration will continue until the condition where "guess" number and the random number matches.
## Noted that number of tries not included in this game(where the game ends after 2 unsuccesful attempts). The goal is to encourage the players to continue on rather than penalize the player for an unsuccessful attempt (we all should be encouraged, not be penalized IMO).

# End-Game:
## The player will be complimented "YOU'VE GOT IT!" when the "guess" number matches the random number.
## The game ends with a goodbye to the player.
